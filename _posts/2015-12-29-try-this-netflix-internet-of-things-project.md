If you're new to IoT, like I am, this may be a great place to start, especially with friends, educators, and students at your side. You see, I don't always watch Netflix but when I do, I prefer to binge watch. That said, I absolutely WANT this button experience at home. null

**Make a NETFLIX BUTTON--directions [here][1]**

> **Settle in---the simple way. One press dims the lights, silences incoming calls, orders takeout, and turns on Netflix.**

What is the Internet of Things, anyway? [A Simple Explanation of the "Internet of Things"][2] by Forbes magazine from 2014 that I like. The IoT is the future. Let's get on with experimenting with it.

Projects like this Netflix give purpose/relevance for newbies (adults, kids) to IoT[â€¬][3]. I see people wanting to make this, enjoying it immensely, and learning in the process. 

[][3]

**3 Ideas to grow \#STEM, MAKER, \#IoT \#this in your city, community, schools:**

1\. **Start with the teachers**. They need to know what it is so they can share the passion and excitement of it and facilitate it in their classrooms. IoT nights in your city or school district. [][4]

2\. **Reach out to tech/business community** for resources, help, collaboration in planning projects and work sessions! Work as a team to do and create.

3\. **Challenge Based IoT.** What could your students or teachers or teams of both make for your school or community using IoT that would solve a problem? 

4\. **Start a club and/or Makerspace at school with IoT projects tied to real life.**

Good info just posted at TechCrunch: [What will the Internet of Things be when it Grows Up?][5]
