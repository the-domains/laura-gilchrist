The Internet of Things (IoT) will be a big part of the future. You might consider reading the article by Jim Hunter (@theiotguru) on Tech Crunch (@techcrunch) asking...

# Here's a great quote from the IoT council

**The Internet of Things (IoT) is a vision**

> It is being built today. The stakeholders are known, the debate has yet to start. In hundreds of years our real needs have not changed. We want to be loved, feel safe, have fun, be relevant in work and friendship, be able to support our families and somehow play a role - however small - in the larger scheme of things. So what will really happen when things, homes and cities become smart? The result will probably be an tsunami of what at first looks like very small steps, small changes. **The purpose of Council is to follow and  forecast what will happen when smart objects surround us in smart homes, offices, streets, and cities.**
